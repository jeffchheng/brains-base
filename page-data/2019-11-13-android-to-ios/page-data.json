Also, I make poor financial decisions all the time.</p>\n<p>Pixel 4 has a pitiful battery and awful performance under load, continuing the tradition from Pixel 3. If I play Pokemon GO, then go to take a photo, it will immediately boot the game out of memory 90% of the time, which takes 9-10 seconds to reload.</p>\n<p>My iPhone 11 Pro does not suffer from these problems. On the occasion it does get booted after some inactivity, it takes 4-5 seconds to reload. The battery can actually last two full days of use. I can just focus on getting the most out of my phone.</p>\n<p>But even so, I still miss Android and the full suite of Google services. So this isn't good-bye forever.</p>\n<h2>Deep dive into the issues with Pixel 3 and 4</h2>\n<p>The final straw for me was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915594/google-pixel-4-xl-no-unlimited-photo-uploads-free-original-quality-backups\">Pixel 4 no longer offering unlimited uploads at original quality</a>. For photos, this wasn't the biggest deal, because Google's compression is very good. I wouldn't've noticed anything except in extreme cases with pixel peeping.</p>\n<p>However, this is a big deal for videos, <em>especially</em> where 4K or 1080p 60fps is concerned. Google's compression for videos is incredibly bad. Coupled with the 64GB of onboard storage, this was unacceptable.</p>\n<p>The writing was already on the wall when the <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_3-9256.php\">spec leaks came</a>; Pixel 4 would only have a 2,800 mAh battery, less than the 2,915 mAh battery on Pixel 3. Sure, SoCs get more efficient every year, but you can't beat physics. A smaller battery was not good.</p>\n<p>My Pixel 3 barely lasted the entire day without having to top it up, even at work, where I'm mostly listening to YouTube or Play Music in the background. Playing Pokemon GO or a day on vacation taking hundreds of photos will kill the phone within a few hours.</p>\n<p>My trip to Greece solidified this when Nicole's iPhone XS was able to take photos all day <em>and</em> play games, whereas my Pixel 3 had to be strapped to an external battery pack 75% of the time to handle the hundreds of photos I was taking.</p>\n<h2>Why iPhone and not another Android phone</h2>\n<p>Resale value and number of updates were the biggest reasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://swappa.com/buy/apple-iphone-7\">iPhone 7</a> versus <a href=\"https://swappa.com/buy/google-pixel\">Pixel 1</a>. (Maybe not the best example since Pixel 1 has unlimited photo storage for life*.)</p>\n<p>Android OEMs are rarely support more than one major Android update before killing the phone, whereas iPhone 6S (2015) works with iOS 13 (2019).</p>\n<p>Since Pixel 2, I've started upgrading every year and selling my old phone on Swappa. I use my phone every single day, so I might as well have the best.</p>\n<h2>The pros of iPhone 11 Pro</h2>\n<p>Battery life is insane. I regularly get two full work days of use before having to charge; I typically run YouTube and Google Play Music in the background. I'll browse Reddit (via Apollo), Twitter, Instagram, and take random photos throughout the day. It just feels better to be able to use my phone how I want, as much as I want.</p>\n<p>I haven't had an intense day of use since owning the phone, but its standby and daily use patterns is really encouraging. I can revisit after another intense photo shoot day.</p>\n<p>App integrations are buttery smooth. After installing LastPass, I was able to effortlessly log into every site and app with a quick FaceID check. SMS 2FA comes into through Messages and will auto-fill without having to copy to clipboard first.</p>\n<p>I can tell companies invest more into their iOS apps than their Android counterparts. The only apps with better or equal performance and user experience are ones using React Native (e.g., Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). Others like Barclays and Chase are probably always going to be shitty, but at least the login experience is less painful with the Apple keyboard/LastPass autofill versus Android's fumbling attempts at autofill.</p>\n<p>Messages/iMessage is also a boon when talking to boomers because they are resistant to using Messenger or other third-party messaging apps (unlike non-US countries). Now they can send me photos and videos that aren't automatically compressed to 2 MB. So that's something.</p>\n<p>Oh, and Messages integration with my work laptop is also great. I can talk to my parents or receive 2FA codes without having to take out my phone. The ecosystem strikes again.</p>\n<p>Gesture navigation and animations feel much more polished. There are less accidental swipes or actions on iPhone, compared to Pixel's clumsy implementation of gesture navigation. Performance in general is just very fast, thanks to the A13 Bionic, which is years ahead of Qualcomm's chips.</p>\n<h2>The cons of iPhone 11 Pro</h2>\n<p>Siri is an embarrassment. Attempting to use Siri as replacement to Google Assistant is a fool's errand. It's <em>only</em> saving grace is programmable shortcuts. For example, I can say \"photos of me,\" and it'll open Google Photos and have the search results ready. Really, this is more praise for Google supporting Siri's shitty API than anything else.</p>\n<p>The home screen is a mess. It's 2019, and I can't move my icons to the bottom of the screen. I still have to create junk folders for the Apple default apps I <em>can't</em> uninstall.</p>\n<p>Almost every Apple analog to Google's services is inferior, save for Apple Pay, which I'd say is slightly better.</p>\n<p>Google Maps > Apple Maps. The only reason I have Apple Maps installed is because Siri needs it to funnel commands <em>to</em> Google Maps. Dark mode support is nice, but actual navigation and <em>map</em> experience are so far behind. Offline maps are a lifesaver in countries without </p>\n<p>Google Photos > Apple Photos. No contest really when it comes to unlimited high-quality backups, which aren't even compressed on iPhones that save images in HEIC. Search is unparalleled, per usual.</p>\n<p>The biggest annoyance is how Apple limits integrations with certain third-party apps. I can't set Google Maps or Chrome as my default apps. Everything must open in Safari unless the app specifically implements a default apps section, which Apple-made apps don't do, of course.</p>\n<h2>What I miss about Pixel/Android</h2>\n<p>Freedom. I miss being able to move my icons to the bottom of the screen. Setting default apps including the launcher. Power users can side-load apps. I was really spoiled for choice on Android.</p>\n<p>Google Assistant and Search integration was so effortless, I didn't know what I lost until it was too late. Assistant knows how to interpret real questions and provide useful answers. Pixel 4 having the assistant exist on the phone without needing to compute anything in the cloud is insane.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why I switched from Pixel to iPhone","date":"November 13, 2019","description":"Blue bubble gang waddup."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-11-13-android-to-ios/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-10-16-terrace-house-tokyo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Terrace House - Tokyo 2019-2020, Part 1"}},"next":null}}}
