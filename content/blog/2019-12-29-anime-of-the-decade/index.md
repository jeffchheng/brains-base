AKA the one anime I watched each year.

## 2010: Katanagari

It's been a while since I watched this. The biggest standouts were the sharp art style, hype music, and memorable main characters. I'll never forget those final two episodes. It's one of the few shows with high stakes battles.

## 2011: Steins;Gate

Time travel is my favorite trope, so this one's a no brainer.

Okabe Rintaro's esoteric team can be grating to some people, but it only makes the contrast of the second half even starker. This juxtaposition of comedy and despair will be copied by countless shows that come after.

All great media must establish characters and stakes before it can properly pay them off, and _Steins;Gate_ does exactly that. It starts slow, but by the second half, it's go-go-go.

## 2012: Psycho-Pass

Sci-fi dystopias are another one of my favorite tropes.

Psycho-Pass is basically a darker minority report. It's brutal and doesn't pull any punches. I like how the villain actually poses a threat to the protagonists and pushes them to their limits. The losses they suffer aren't superficial either.

The high stakes of this show make it one of the stand-out shows of the decade, for sure.

### 2012 Runner Up: Fate/Zero, Season 2

_Fate/Zero_ really picks up steam after all the characters and motivations have been set up. _Fate/Zero_'s protagonist, Kiritsugu Emiya, is literally that guy who says, "If this was real life, I would do [X] instead of [Y]." He's such an edge lord, but I love his brutal battlefield tactics.

He's contrasted by Saber, the idealist, and it does a lot to set up her character for _Unlimited Blade Works_. I always love when there are two main characters with opposing viewpoints.

## 2013: Wolf Children

I remember watching this with my mom, and she cried the entire time. A story about a single mother raising two eponymous wolf children probably hits parents even harder.

Mamoru Hosoda is an expert at balancing the whimsical and fantastical elements with universal themes.

## 2014: Love Live! School Idol Project, Season 2

I never wanted to watch this show because I thought only creeps and girls were into _Love Live_. I don't remember why, but I eventually started watching it while working out. It was when I was still obese, and this show motivated me to go out every night because I wanted to see what happened.

It's a show about nine girls doing their best to become the greatest school idols, and god dammit, they did it. The final episodes and throwbacks to season one were truly... _chef's kiss_

## 2015: Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, Season 2

Ufotable's animation is definitely one of the standouts.



## 2016: ERASED



### 2016 Runner Up: My Hero Academia



## 2017: Your Name

I watched _Your Name_ at least 4 times in theaters.

### 2017 Honorable Mention #1: Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid

This show is such a sweet slice-of-life.

### 2017 Honorable Mention #2: Recovery of an MMO Junkie

Super relatable.

### 2017 Honorable Mention #3: Tsukigakirei

I'm a sucker for romance.

## 2018: My Hero Academia, Season 3

I'm so used to shonen shows not dealing with the consequences of the main character's actions. Here, Midoriya's recklessness produces some truly wince-worthy moments, and it permanently alters his character. That's what made Season 3 of the most memorable shows of all time.

A lot of shonen try to stall out character arcs or meaningful progress, but not _My Hero Academia_. One of the longest standing threads from season one comes to a definitive close, and sets up the next generation of heroes and stories.

## 2019: Shadowbringers 

Does this count?

_Shadowbringers_ is definitely in my top 2 Final Fantasy stories of all time. The way it treats the Warrior of Light as a real character and humanizes the scheming Ascians were two of my biggest complaints about _Final Fantasy XIV_'s story.

## Anime of the Decade: Your Name
