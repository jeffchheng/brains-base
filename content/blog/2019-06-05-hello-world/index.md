Welcome to my blog where I'll ramble about web dev, video games, and TV. Will anyone read this? Who knows...

Maybe this'll be a good place to catalog my thoughts and see how they change over time. Considering how quickly the web moves, I'll probably end up with egg on my face, but it'll be a good time capsule to look back on. Already, what I thought was best practice in 2018 hadn't necessarily translated into 2019, and it certainly won't be the same in 2020.

Nah, I'll just delete the posts where I look stupid. üòè (No one look at the commit history pls.)
