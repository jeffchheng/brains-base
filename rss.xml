Will anyone read this? Who knows...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this&apos;ll be a good place to catalog my thoughts and see how they change over time. Considering how quickly the web moves, I&apos;ll probably end up with egg on my face, but it&apos;ll be a good time capsule to look back on. Already, what I thought was best practice in 2018 hadn&apos;t necessarily translated into 2019, and it certainly won&apos;t be the same in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah, I&apos;ll just delete the posts where I look stupid. üòè (No one look at the commit history pls.)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
